## The USA/Canada Alumni Chapter

The USA/Canada chapter of FGGC Onitsha was founded in 2009, originally by a few alumni from the pioneer class of '82 through the class of '86, and has quickly extended to include active alumni from across various graduating years. The chapter was founded with the following primary objectives: 
 
1. Supporting the institution, which guided us through our formative years, by enhancing the educational and living environment, and the activities of the institution.  
2. Providing social and professional networks for the current and future alumni across North America.


The chapter's membership continues to grow, and its social activities and charitable works, have garnered the recognition and support of the school, as well as other alumni chapters around the world.

### School Anthem

*Set to the theme of Beethoven's 9th Symphony*

By the waters of the Niger  
Flowing slowly to the seas  
Stands a seat of Education  
Built to foster unity

Onitsha, Anambra State  
Is where we live and learn together  
Strive to make Nigeria great.

We are students of Nigeria  
And we come from far and near

In the school we hold so dear  
Walking ever Pro Unitate  
We live in peace and Unity  
With loyalty we work together  
Marching on in Unity.
