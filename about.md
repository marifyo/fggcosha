## The USA/Canada Alumni Chapter

The USA/Canada chapter of FGGC Onitsha was founded in 2009, originally by a few alumnae from the pioneer class of '82 through the class of '86, and has quickly extended to include active alumnae from across various graduating years. 
<br> <br>
The chapter's membership continues to grow, and its social activities and charitable works, have garnered the recognition and support of the school, as well as other alumni chapters around the world.

### Our Mission 
> To provide opportunities for FGGC Onitsha alumnae across North America, to collectively give back for the continued growth and development of our Alma Mater and the society, and to promote networking between alumnae that enrich their professional and personal lives.
