> There are few things more life-changing and rewarding than assisting in the creation and welcoming of new life to our beautiful world.

In this wonderful season of Christmas when we celebrate the birth of Jesus and the miracle of life, birth and salvation, it seems fitting that our December spotlight is our very own Dr. Milie Nwoye-Delmotte, a class of 1995 alumna of F.G.G.C. Onitsha and renowned U.S. board-certified Obstetrician & Gynecologist and European trained fertility specialist.

Dr. Nwoye owns and operates a cutting-edge private clinic in Belgium, and is the youngest Nigerian to do so. 

Mmiliaku, or Milie as she is fondly called, is the 1st child of five born in Enugu, Nigeria to well-educated professional parents. She notably excelled all through her primary education in Enugu and arrived at Federal Government Girls’ College, Onitsha having passed the entrance examinations with flying colours. Throughout her stay in school, she maintained the highest standards of learning, taught her peers in many subjects, was a Zinnia House prefect and a devoted born-again member of the school fellowship. Even in her Senior Secondary days in the extremely competitive “B-class” (Pure Sciences), she held her own as a top contender and subsequently graduated in 1995 with exceptional results. I remember her as a very neat, perfectionist, humble, devout, slender and ridiculously “brainy” 6-footer who, had she chosen to, would have made a fabulous supermodel.

Her pursuit for excellence led her to the United States where she received her bachelor science degree in pre-professional Zoology & Chemistry with Magna cum laude. She then received her medical school training at Northwestern University Medical School Chicago, a top 20 U.S medical school receiving Honors in the fields of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Internal Medicine and Surgical Oncology. In addition to her extracurricular charitable causes pursued off-duty, she received the award for the Best Laparoscopic Surgeon during her O&G residency in Boston before continuing on to other postgraduate trainings in New York, Massachusetts and Antwerp culminating in a Fellowship at CRG-UZ, Brussels.

Her pursuit for love led her to Belgium where she currently lives with her handsome husband and adorable 2+-year old daughter. While in Belgium, she received further training in the field of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the Center for Reproductive Medicine of the University hospital of Brussels renowned for inventing the procedure ICSI (Intra-Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection) where the sperm cell is individually injected into the egg cell. This revolutionary procedure has been so successful that across the world more than 50% of IVF is performed using this technique.

Dr. Nwoye provides couples with the combination of a customized, patient-centered experience and the services of the second biggest IVF center in Europe, plus offers longer consultation times, quality care and ultra-modern medical facilities. Asides routine gynecologic care services, to intending moms, she offers a ‘preconception’ service designed to optimize a woman’s health before pregnancy. To pregnant Moms-to-be, she offers a world-class clinic birthing experience.

In her spare time, she loves to inspire young students and females from less privileged backgrounds and to help them achieve their best sexual and reproductive health. Believing that quality health is a basic human right, she feels very passionately about providing highest standards of care, highest patient satisfaction and impeccable patient education while simultaneously educating medical students and residents.

She has written various groundbreaking publications, made professional presentations and belongs to 7 globally-acclaimed professional Boards, Colleges and Organizations.
