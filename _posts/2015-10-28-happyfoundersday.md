Remembering our founders day today. 

Lots of good and not so good stuff have happened to the school and students over the past 38 years I think. 

Wonderful lasting friendships have been formed. That's the part I treasure most. 

We thank God for our lives and what we've become. 

To our sisters who are no longer with us, continue to rest in the sweet comfortable bosom of our Lord. 

To Mrs Mary Okobi, you will never be forgotten. Your legacy lives on!!!!!

To the rest of us, I sing "it's our birthday
{% highlight text %} 
It's our birthday 
I'm a spend my money
Pretty lady, pretty lady
You should be my honey
Lot of mercy, lot of mercy
Pretty baby, come with me
It's our birthday 
It's our birthday 
I'm a live my fantasy 
{% endhighlight %}
