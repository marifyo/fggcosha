## 3rd Alumni Reunion/Convention 

The alumni chapter cordially invites all FGGC Onitsha alumni, along with their friends and family, to our 3rd reunion/convention weekend, which takes place this year in **Baltimore, MD**. 

Atlanta 2011 and Houston 2012 were great! Maryland 2014 promises to be even better. **Don't miss out. Start making your arrangements today.**

### Why Come?

1. It will be **FUN**. This year's reunion organizers have been working diligently to put together an absolutely amazing weekend that promises to entertain, excite and exceed all expectations. You just can't miss it.
2. The opportunity to connect with a large group of your schoolmates, from across different classes, in such a vibrant and fun social setting is one you won't find anywhere else.
3. It was largely due to the funds raised at the past two reunions that we were able to meet our initial give-back objective. Join us in helping make our next goal a reality. Let's keep on giving back.
