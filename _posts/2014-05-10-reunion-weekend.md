## 3rd Alumni Reunion/Convention 

The alumni chapter cordially invites all FGGC Onitsha alumni, along with their friends and family, to our 3rd reunion/convention weekend which takes place this year in **Baltimore, MD**. 

Atlanta 2011 and Houston 2012 were great! Maryland 2014 promises to be even better. **Don't miss out. Start making your arrangements today.**
