Those who attended our alma mater in the ‘80 - 90s will surely remember Mrs. Obiesie, perhaps as Vice Principal from 1983 to XXX, or as the successor to our founding Principal, Mrs. Okobi, serving as Principal from 1988 to XXX.

<br>
Mrs. Elizabeth Obiesie, the second principal of the then still young FGGC Onitsha, gave several years of her life and self to the institution, serving with the dedication, dignity and grace that epitomized her principles.

<br>
Indeed, from what I have learned of our former principal, these could have been her words.

We invite you to get to know this amazing woman, yet another woman of substance and influence, who contributed much towards the individual and collective development of her students and the school she served, through the words of her daughter and alumna, Anwuli.

My first memory of my mother was at the age of 3. I saw her sitting in front of her dressing mirror, applying her lipstick, combing her hair and adjusting her clothes and I was instantly fascinated. She noticed my intense looks and smiled, held out her arms and lifted me up; her words to me that day was that no matter how hard you work, taking out time to look tidy and presentable was very key. She added that this will aid my organization in life with relation to academics, career and home making, and looking back to this point, it has been an advice that has been of tremendous value to my siblings and I.
 
<br>
Elizabeth Ozoemena Obiesie was born xx years ago in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria. She excelled at her studies and proceeded to the United Kingdom for her secondary school education. Afterwards, she attended Howard University in the United States and graduated with a BA degree in Education. She met my father upon her return to England, he had finished his law degree from the University of Dublin in Ireland, and after two years of courtship, they got married, relocated to Nigeria and had four children - 3 girls and a boy.

<br> 
My mother first came to work in FGGC Onitsha in 1983 as the vice principal, administering under Mrs. Mary Okobi, who was the principal of the school at the time. It was a very sobering period for my sister, Chinwe and I, then both students of the school, as she had drilled into us the dire consequences of bad behavior under her watch. She expected us to be at the top of the class academically and of excellent behavior outside the class room. <br> In fairness to her, her standards were not unrealistic. The problem was my sister and I were just too rascally to avoid trouble. Although Chinwe did meet the expected academic standard, I managed to scale through with the achievable goal each term not to be at the bottom of the class for fear of what punitive consequences awaited me at home during the holidays!
 
<br>
She left FGGC Onitsha for FGGC Akure for some years and later returned as principal in 1988. Her record as principal was recognized both by parents and colleagues as an excellent one - academic standards were high; and the dormitories, classrooms and school compound were always in clean and hygienic conditions. 

<br>
What I remember quite vividly was her insistence that all the girls from forms 1-6 be allowed to grow their hair, if they so desired. She felt that women should learn the art of good grooming and appearance from a very young age.  She firmly believed that if one could be organized with one's appearance, it would be easy to be organized in other areas of life. This didn't surprise me that all, as she had always emphasized that women could be all-rounders in everything they set their hearts and hands to, looking good and tidy included.

<br> 
Here is a recent picture of her taken in June of 2014 with some of her grand children: my son CJ & her eldest grand daughter Nwando. I am so proud to say that she still looks as amazing as I remember her to be while growing up.

My sisters, brother and I try every day to improve on who we are so as not to forget the home we came from and the valuable training on academics, career, manners, etiquette and cleanliness we received from our parents, which we are passing on to our children.

<br> 
In conclusion, I would like to give a shout out to all the ladies of the 1986 class of FGGC Onitsha. You were all amazing to meet and I look forward to seeing the remarkable women you are today. 

<br>
Thank you so much for the honor of writing this piece on the most important woman in my life. 

<br>
God bless
