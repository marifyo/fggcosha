## Have you paid your membership dues? 

If not, here's our reminder to you to pay your $100 annual membership fee. 

New members have an additional $20 registration fee, a one-time payment.

Payment plans are available. Contact [the Financial Secretary](mailto:chinwe.onyekwelu@fggconitsha.com) for options.

As always, you are the strength of this chapter.
