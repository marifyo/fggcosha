## Planning Update

Although over a year away, the excitement is already heating up as we engage in choosing the venue for our next reunion weekend. 

### Where will it be?
* What city will be hosting the group of highly engaged and exciting members as we come together once more to celebrate sisterhood, unity and progress?
* What group of committed alumna will be involved in the planning and execution of what will surely be a weekend to remember?
* Who will answer the call to serve, to give, to contribute to the success of 2016 and continued growth of our Alumnae chapter?

After reviewing the logistics involved in hosting the 2016 reunion weekend in Toronto, Canada, as previously decided at the 2014 reunion weekend, and based on feedback from the alumnae, both in the US and across the globe, a decision was made to move the destination back to the U.S of A until the world shrinks sufficiently as to make Toronto the successful host we fully expect it to be in the future.

<br>
At the March 14 2015 meeting, two (2) locations were shortlisted and are currently being reviewed as candidate hosts for the 2016 Reunion Weekend: *Los Angeles* and *New Jersey/New York*.

<br>
Over the next few weeks, both locations will be assessed and a vote set up to decide on the final destination.

Please answer the call as we reach out to you to participate in this selection process. You are vital to the success of this chapter!
