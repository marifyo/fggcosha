Thanks to all those who attended our June 13th 2015 meeting. We had a good turnout and updates.

Here is a brief recap of the discussions:

* Planning Committee Update: Chinwe Abaelu provided a brief update on the planning effort. The location has not yet been confirmed but they have been evaluating options and costs. The goal remains to have a location locked down by August.
* Publicity/PR Committee Update: Ifeyinwa Obi presented the Theme that the committee had determined for LA 2015 - "Fostering Unity". Theme/Event logo is underway to be finalized by the next meeting. The committee had also kicked off its first campaign to promote LA 2016 - Photo Search. Details are on the Facebook page.
* Establishment of Non-profit Org: Chinwe Abaelu provided update on the establishment of a sister organization that will serve as our non-profit organization for donations and projects. The process is underway.
* Membership Dues Reminder: Members were urged to pay their dues. Approximately 20% of members have paid their dues and so we need all others to pay. Paypal is now a convenient option to make payments.
* Next Meeting is on Saturday, August 8th.
