November winners are in and there is much inspiration to be drawn from them. Check them out on our [Facebook Accouncement Post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Fggcoshathegreatest/permalink/10153159505676244/).

## Universal Cancer Awareness - Class of '89
This picture was selected because it reflects our sisterhood and our love for giving back to our communities. Cancer is an ailment everyone can relate to, it has affected everyone one way or the other. Our sisters coming together to create awareness of its impacts made us proud.

## Chinwe and Amede, Class of '89 - LA, CA
The joy emanating from the 2 sisters captured our hearts. Chinwe was supporting Amede at her fashion show. The quality of the picture also made it a must for this month's selection.
