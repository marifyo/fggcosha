## Our First Success Story

We are delighted to announce that our alma mater has received the School Bus. After two years of planning and collaboration, on **_November 15 2013_**, the school bus, purchased by the FGGC Onitsha USA/Canada Alumni Chapter, through our collective fund-raising efforts, was delivered to the school.
