As we count down the months to our LA 2016 Reunion next July, it is clear that reunion fever is actively spreading and is the theme for most of the submissions for October. It is little surprise that 2 of our 3 winners were from Reunion events. 

## A Picture of Class - 1990's Ladies 25th Anniversary Reunion in Lagos, Nigeria
The class of 1990 reuniting through several days of celebration and sisterhood, had so many wonderful pictures and videos which drew oohs and aahs, as well as a touch of envy from various classes. This picture taken at their formal dinner with the beautiful and very classy ladies just had to win our judges votes.
