Thanks to all those who attended our May 9th 2015 meeting. We had a great turnout and lots of significant updates.

<br>
The major highlights of those discussions are as follows:

* Alma Mater Updates: Our chapter president, Juliet Ume-Onyido gave us an update from her recent visit to our Alma Mater, along with ideas for our next project.
* Reunion Committees: The committees for our Reunion weekend were announced along with the initial members. Others are invited to join any committee and help make LA 2016 a huge success.
* PayPal Update: You can now pay your fees via our PayPal account. Donations to the chapter can also be made via PayPal. Details to come later.
* Sisters helping one another: The plight of our dear sister and fellow alum, Ijeoma Okponwa, who urgently requires a kidney transplant and funds to make that happen, was discussed. Collection account for alumnae who wish to help will be sent out via email. 

If you are a member of this alumnae chapter and do not receive the Meeting Minutes, please contact [Ijeoma Ejiofor Onwuogu](mailto:ijeoma.ejiofor@fggconitsha.com) to get your contact information updated.

As always, you are the strength of this chapter.

*Igwebuike Anyi!*
