October. The most powerful month in the calendar year for women’s causes. 

**Breast Cancer Awareness**
<br>
**Domestic Violence Awareness**

Issues which have directly impacted our lives or the life of at least one person we know.

Indeed the month of Pink and Purple is one which is recognized across the globe and many have rallied to raise awareness, funding and support for these two causes.

Many of our alumna have been involved in some form or the other. In particular, we want to acknowledge the class of ’89’s own Oge Nwakoby Ilegbune, who having recently relocated from the UK to Nigeria, has been passionately and actively raising awareness for breast cancer in our home country.

The hashtag, #BeBreastWise", and her mission engaged her fellow alumna classmates who banded and joined in her cause, raising breast cancer awareness in the month of October. From the shores of Nigeria, in the UK and even to the U.S., class of 1989 alumnae gathered, some in public places, using their branded t-shirts as a conversation piece for anyone they met, some even involved their colleagues in various ways.

Indeed, we celebrate the class of ’89, along with Dr. Mrs. Oge Nwakoby Ilegbune, for their active participation in the cause.

Another champion of these predominantly women’s causes is our very own Chapter President, Juliet Ume-Onyido, who is very active in the empowerment and liberation of women, and in raising awareness and providing support for survivors of Domestic Violence. With her empowering and enlightening posts shared on FB and her website, http://www.wholewomannetwork.com, we get an insight into how she has touched the lives of women who have struggled, some surviving, some not so fortunate, as they strive to break the chains of domestic violence in their lives.

We are Women! We are powerful! We can do much! When you wake up tomorrow, know that you have many gifts, know that you are empowered, know that you can make a difference that day, know that you can and DO make a difference, you add tremendous value; don’t ever let anyone tell you otherwise.

Step Out, Step Up, Be, Give, Live!

> Friday's are dress down days in my office so I wore my breast cancer awareness T-shirt to work. My goal was to initiate conversations regarding breast cancer awareness with at least 50 people. It was interesting to hear the stories people have about how breast cancer have touched their lives and the lives of their loved ones. I had goose bumps at the end of the day and I ended up talking to over 100 of my colleagues simply because they were curious about the T-shirt. Our IT guy told me that his Grandma, Mum and sister all had it and beat the odds through regular follow up and self exam. It was story after story and quite a fulfilling day. I also had a Russian colleague that did not realize that she could get a free Mammogram for her Mum via some Mammo centers since her Mum visits occasionally and does not have health Insurance in the U.S.
