The 3rd Alumni USA/Canada Chapter Reunion Weekend, which took place in Maryland from July 25th - 27th 2014, was a smashing success!

<br>
From the Friday night social gathering event at Peju's Lounge, the Saturday Boat Cruise where alumni and family had a whale of a time, to the very festive Saturday Gala Night; the entire weekend was filled with wonderful activities wholeheartedly embraced and well attended by our enthusiastic alumni and friends.

<br>
A huge Thank You to all who attended or contributed in any way to making this happen.

<br>
Please stay tuned. We'll be sharing the tidbits on the weekend bit by bit.
