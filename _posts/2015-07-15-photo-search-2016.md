As the FGGC Onitsha USA/Canada Alumnae Chapter counts down to LA 2016, the organizers are embarking on a Photo Contest/Search for the "CLOSEST/CUTEST FGGCO ALUMNAE GROUP".

The fabulous thing - ALL Sets & ALL Locations are eligible!

To participate, take a photo with your alumnae group, name your photo & upload it to the Facebook Album [Road to LA 2016 - Photo Search: Alumnae GROUP of The Year](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=oa.10152892392226244&type=1) and hashtag ‪#‎FGGCOPhotoSearch‬.

Points will be awarded for Creativity, Numbers (the more Alumnae in the pic, the merrier!) and Overall Fun element/vibe in each pic.

Members can appear in as many photos as they want but only ONE PHOTO PER GROUP PER EVENT IS ACCEPTED so be sure to sync up with your mates on which is the best!

### RULES: 
* Everyone in the pic must be an ALUMNUS. 
* The picture must have been taken in 2015/2016. No digging into the archives here.

Come On! Start snapping, hashtagging & uploading!

Entries will be accepted from July 10th 2015 to Jan 31st 2016.

The winning group will be announced at the LA Convention in July 2016! Will YOU be there?

Post your pics! Join the Fun!

*Note:* You must be a member of the Facebook Alumnae group “FGGC ONITSHA: The Greatest” to upload the picture.
