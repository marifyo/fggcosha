FGGC Onitsha Alumnae Association, USA/Canada Chapter invites you to her 4th Reunion Weekend this summer in Los Angeles, CA from July 26th - 28th 2016.

Our reunion weekend, held every other year is always a very special event, a wonderful package put together for alumna, friends and family, and this one hosted in the city of dreams, promises to be the best one yet.

There will be several activities lined up for alumna and their guests, starting with the Friday Social Gathering night where guests get to kick off their heels and dance the night away, to the Saturday 4-hour Guided Bus Tour around the City of Angels and culminating in our not to be missed grand event, the Black Tie - Dress-to-Kill Gala and Fundraising Ball on Saturday Night.
